### Password Guessing
- **Description**: Systematic guessing of passwords to gain unauthorized access.
- **Example**: Using a dictionary attack to guess passwords.
- **Mitigation**: Enforce strong password policies and limit login attempts.

### Insufficient Password Policies
- **Description**: Weak password requirements lead to easily guessable passwords.
- **Example**: Allowing passwords like "123456" or "password."
- **Mitigation**: Enforce complexity requirements and password expiration.

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Bypass
- **Description**: Attackers bypass MFA mechanisms using social engineering or phishing.
- **Example**: Capturing a one-time code sent via SMS.
- **Mitigation**: Use app-based authentication methods and educate users about phishing.

---

## Session Management Vulnerabilities

### Session Fixation
- **Description**: Attacker tricks the user into using a specific session ID.
- **Example**: Setting a session ID before login.
- **Mitigation**: Regenerate session IDs after login.

### Session Hijacking
- **Description**: Attacker steals or intercepts a valid session token.
- **Example**: Using a tool like Wireshark to capture session cookies.
- **Mitigation**: Use secure cookie attributes (e.g., HttpOnly, Secure).

### Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI)
- **Description**: Attacker includes scripts from another origin to capture session tokens.
- **Example**: Using a malicious script in a legitimate website.
- **Mitigation**: Validate and sanitize input; use CSP.

### Predictable Session IDs
- **Description**: Using predictable session tokens that can be guessed.
- **Example**: Using sequential or predictable session IDs.
- **Mitigation**: Use cryptographically secure random session IDs.

---

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Stored XSS
- **Description**: Malicious scripts stored on the server and delivered to users.
- **Example**: Inputting `<script>alert('Hacked!')</script>` in a comment field.
- **Mitigation**: Encode output data and validate input.

### Reflected XSS
- **Description**: Malicious scripts are reflected off a web server and executed in the user’s browser.
- **Example**: A link that includes a script in the URL parameter.
- **Mitigation**: Validate input and escape output.

### DOM-based XSS
- **Description**: Vulnerability occurs in the client-side code rather than the server.
- **Example**: Manipulating the DOM with unsafe methods.
- **Mitigation**: Use safe APIs for DOM manipulation.

---

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

### CSRF Attacks
- **Description**: Attacker tricks the user into submitting a request without their consent.
- **Example**: Sending a request to transfer funds from a user’s bank account.
- **Mitigation**: Use anti-CSRF tokens in forms and verify HTTP referer headers.

---

## Security Misconfiguration

### Default Credentials
- **Description**: Using default passwords and settings that are widely known.
- **Example**: Leaving the admin password as "admin."
- **Mitigation**: Change default passwords and settings upon installation.

### Unrestricted File Upload
- **Description**: Allowing users to upload files without restrictions.
- **Example**: Uploading a PHP shell disguised as an image file.
- **Mitigation**: Validate file types and restrict upload locations.

### Insecure HTTP Headers
- **Description**: Missing security headers that protect against common vulnerabilities.
- **Example**: Lack of `Content-Security-Policy` or `X-Content-Type-Options`.
- **Mitigation**: Implement secure HTTP headers.

### Error Handling Misconfigurations
- **Description**: Detailed error messages expose sensitive information.
- **Example**:

 Displaying stack traces in production environments.
- **Mitigation**: Customize error messages and log errors securely.

---

## Sensitive Data Exposure

### Insecure Data Transmission
- **Description**: Transmitting sensitive data over unencrypted channels.
- **Example**: Using HTTP instead of HTTPS for login forms.
- **Mitigation**: Enforce HTTPS for all communications.

### Data at Rest Exposure
- **Description**: Sensitive data stored without encryption.
- **Example**: Storing passwords in plaintext.
- **Mitigation**: Use strong encryption for stored data.

### Insufficient Encryption
- **Description**: Using weak or outdated encryption algorithms.
- **Example**: Using DES instead of AES for encryption.
- **Mitigation**: Implement strong, up-to-date encryption standards.

---

## Broken Access Control

### Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
- **Description**: Users can access objects they shouldn’t be able to.
- **Example**: Accessing `/user/123` when the user is only authorized for `/user/456`.
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper authorization checks on all requests.
